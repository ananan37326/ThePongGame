# Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game **Pong** using the Turtle module in Python. The game consists of two paddles controlled by the player and a ball that bounces around the screen. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The ball's speed increases every time it hits a paddle. The game ends when one of the players reaches 10 points.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have **Python 3** installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ananan37326/ThePongGame.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd ThePongGame
```

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script.
```python
python main.py
```
2. Movement
--1. Player 1: Use the `W` and `S` keys to move the paddle up and down.
--2. Player 2: Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move the paddle up and down.
3. The ball will bounce off the top and bottom walls and the paddles.
4. If the ball passes your opponent's paddle, you score a point.
5. The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined number of points (set inside `scoreboard.py`).

## Acknowledgements
This project was created as part of the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 course by Dr. Angela Yu.

This game was created using the Turtle module, a graphics library included in the Python standard library. It was inspired by the classic game Pong, which was originally created by Atari in 1972.
